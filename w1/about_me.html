    <h2>Recent Travels</h2>
    <p>I recently visited South East Asia for the first time. Jakarta, Indonesia and 
            Singapore, although only an little over an hour apart from each other, they could not be 
            more different. Both cities have a dense population but Singapore seemed to
            prioritize visually appealing landscape while Jakarta represented a more 
            practical approach to urban planning. Both were equally beautiful and I walked
            away wishing I had more time.

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>Although not quite a restaurant but rather an ice cream place: <a href="https://saffronrosepersianicecream.com" target="_blank">Saffron Rose Persian Ice Cream</a>. 
       They have a saffron Persian ice cream that is both fragrant and silky mixed with pistachios. I sometimes dream about it and always try to make it a pit stop during my travels to LA. </p>

        <p>One of my favorite foods is Poke. It has a ton of fresh ingredients and it's a great way to combine whole foods and often raw fish in a delicious way that is new everytime.</p>
